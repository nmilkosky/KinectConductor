A framework to allow recording and replaying Kinect sessions.
The core of the recording/replay framework is based on the work done by David Catuhe on [Kinect Toolbox](http://kinecttoolbox.codeplex.com), also explained in his book "Programming with the Kinect For Windows SDK".

The audio recording/replay is an experimental feature and not very stable
